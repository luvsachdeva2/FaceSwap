# Face Swap with Python and dlib

## Overview

This Python application allows you to perform face swaps in images using the dlib library with the pre-trained model `shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks`. By identifying and swapping facial landmarks, you can create fun and creative face swap images.

Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Place the images you want to perform face swaps on in the project directory.
Run the face_swap.py script
Follow the on-screen instructions to select the source and target images for the face swap.
The script will process the images, identify facial landmarks, and perform the face swap.
The resulting face-swapped image will be saved in the project directory.
